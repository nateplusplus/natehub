					<h2>Who is Nathan Blair?</h2>
					<p>I'm a web developer at <a href="https://www.indeed.com" target="_blank">Indeed</a> and a watercolor painter,
						living in Austin, Texas.</p>
					<p>Before learning to code, I  was a freelance Cinematographer in New York City for seven years. After graduating
						from S.C.A.D, I went from scraping the bottom of Craigslist for the oddest of odd jobs to being on set with
						celebrities like Kate McKinnon and Stephen Baldwin.</p>
					<p>Years later, I was gradually drawn toward web development while building custom WordPress themes for actors.</p>
					<p>When I moved to Austin in 2015, I fully committed to the tech industry. I worked for the civic engagement
						tech startup, <a href="https://givepulse.com" target="_blank">Givepulse</a>, for two years and helped
						them to double their active users. I did contract work for a large energy consultancy named 5, building
						custom analytics software that shaved hours off their weekly workload. I also took on freelance consulting
						work with renowned Austin architect and UT professor, Larry Speck, helping him to redesign his website for
						modern best practices.</p>
					<p>At Indeed, I've worked hard to drive the Marketing Technology team toward our goal of a more unified web
						experience across our landing pages and microsites, while also helping Marketers more easily build and
						maintain web pages. My proudest accomplishments so far have been helping to drive the blog site <a href="https://www.indeed.com/lead" target="_blank">Lead
						with Indeed</a> to a successful launch and developing the foundations for our modular page-building framework.</p>
