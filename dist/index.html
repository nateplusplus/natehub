I’m also a watercolor painter, photographer, novice hiker, gardener, husband, and a cat and dog dad!</p><p>Before learning to code, I studied filmmaking at S.C.A.D., graduating with a B.F.A. in 2008. Straight out of college (with that young ambitious spirit), I spent years building a successful freelance career as a Cinematographer in New York City. I went from scraping the bottom of Craigslist for the oddest of odd jobs to being on set with celebrities like Kate McKinnon and Stephen Baldwin.</p><p>After several years in the film industry, I was gradually drawn toward web development and this eventually became my new passion when I developed custom WordPress themes for actors.</p><p>When I moved to Austin in 2015, I fully committed to the tech industry. I worked for the civic engagement tech startup, Givepulse, for two years and helped them to double their active users. I did contract work for a large energy consultancy named 5, building custom analytics software that shaved hours off their weekly workload. I also took on freelance consulting work with renowned Austin architect and UT professor, Larry Speck, helping him to redesign his website for modern best practices.</p><p>At Indeed, I’ve worked hard to drive the Marketing Technology team toward our goal of a more unified web experience across our landing pages and microsites, while also helping Marketers more easily build and maintain web pages. My proudest accomplishments so far have been helping to drive the blog site “Lead with Indeed” to a successful launch and developing the foundations for our new modular page-building framework.</p></div></div></main></body></html>
